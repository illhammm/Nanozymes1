print('Abstract:'
       'Artificial enzymes are nanoscale compounds that mimic the catalytic activity of enzymes'
       ' and are considered to replace them in various fields. They not only have high catalytic activity' 
       'and specificity, but also are convenient for mass production, storage and transportation. This project'
       ' aims at materials design, for the rapid and directed development of artificial enzymes.'
       'Nanomaterial parameters, organic coating, integration and assay conditions are evaluated to determine'
       'their activity.')
